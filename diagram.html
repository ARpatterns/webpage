                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>AR pattern diagrams can be seen as a kind of pseudo code representation for Augmented Reality
                        functionalities. They work as a rough documentation and help to comprehend the triggering,
                        decision control, and execution mechanism of AR behavior.</p>

                    <p>AR experiences are heavily driven by elements detected in the real world, without having control
                        over their occurrence and timing during the creation process. The reactive behavior and dynamic
                        scenography of AR/MR experiences are therefore modeled as event-driven reactions described as <a
                            href="https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/tree/main/eca">Event-Condition-Action</a> (ECA)
                        rules that perform an action in response to an event, provided that certain conditions are met.
                        In the context of AR patterns, ECA rules build a generic technology-agnostic abstraction of the
                        reactive behavior of AR software systems.</p>

                    <p>Together with visual <a href="/webpage/illustrations.html">illustrations</a> of the
                        scene, AR pattern diagrams help teams stay productive by making it easier to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigate AR scenarios without reading source code.</li>
                        <li>Plan out new features before programming.</li>
                        <li>Quickly onboard new team members.</li>
                        <li>Collaborate with technical and non-technical team members.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Rule-Reaction Block</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to provide a compact visualization of active Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules we
                        developed a diagram representation consisting of rule-reaction blocks. The first line of a
                        rule-reaction block in such a diagram shows the active rule as an Event-Condition-Action triple.
                        Below the rule a blockquoted line follows which depicts the changed state as reaction.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/webpage/images/abstractEvent.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        If no condition is defined, it evaluates to true, and the diagram shows an immediate execution
                        arrow (&rarr;).
                    </p>
                    <img src="/webpage/images/abstractImmediate.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        To illustrate the use of the diagram, consider the following example which presents an active
                        rule triggered by a temporal event (in 20 seconds). If no item is found in the current AR
                        session (the condition), the action will provide a voice feedback (the reaction) using a
                        text-to-speech system.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/webpage/images/sampleEvent.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Several ECA rules may be loaded and installed at the same time. They are shown as sequences of
                        rule-reaction blocks. Be aware that they are installed at the same time but may not be triggered
                        at the that time.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/webpage/images/sequence.png" alt="" />

                    <p>An action may dynamically load and run new consecutive rules. These rules are displayed as
                        indented block quotes consisting of one or several sequential rules. All rules in a block are
                        loaded and installed in sequence, yet not (all) executed at loading time, but triggered by their
                        corresponding event.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to write an AR Pattern Diagram?</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>List the items that will augment the real world as media assets (e.g., 3D models, parametric
                            geometries, images, audio files, text). These items should then be tagged by ECA rules.</li>
                        <li>Enumerate potential events that may occur during the AR session and will trigger behavior
                            and interactivity. See typical
                            <a href="https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/eca/events.md">Events in AR
                                applications</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Arrange the enumerated items and events into Event-Condition-Action rules that will
                            manipulate media items, run-time data, and system settings.</li>
                        <li>Whenever possible, use the generic action identifiers listed in
                            <a href="https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/eca/actions.md">Actions in AR
                                Applications</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Depict the reaction of the triggered action.</li>
                        <li>Write down the rule-reaction blocks in
                            <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</a> by applying the corresponding
                            <a href="#markdown-mappings-for-ar-pattern-diagrams">styling</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Integrate and render the diagram as embedded documentation, e.g., in README files within
                            GitHub repositories or in web-based technical documentation.</li>
                    </ol>
