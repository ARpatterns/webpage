							<h2>Using the Miro Board to Create Illustrations</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						   We provide a Miro board that contains all the basic elements that were used to create the explanatory illustrations on the Patterns. 
						   The Miro board provides a powerful way to visualize AR patterns by offering various pre-designed elements. 
						   These elements can be combined to create new and innovative AR examples and to collaborate on the requirements and implementation of the patterns into new applications and use-cases. 
						   This guide will walk you through how to use these elements to bring your AR concepts to life.

						<h3>Scenario Elements</h3>
						<p>
						   The Miro board contains a variety of elements that can be used to create AR scenarios. 
						   These elements include some Environments (indoor / outdoor), objects such as plants and tables, and perspectively correct anchors. 
						   Depending on the application, you may want to choose from different different representations of the same objects that fit the overall design.  and interactive controls.

						<h3>1. Access the Miro Board</h3>
						<p>To start building your own scenarios, access the Miro board. You’ll find a collection of AR elements that you can drag and arrange into unique compositions.</p>

						<h3>2. Select the Right Elements</h3>

						<p>Copy the empty frame at the bottom of the board and mix/match the Scenario elements to 
						   create an interactive AR experience. For example, place objects in an environment of your choosing,
