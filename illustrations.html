							<h2>Using the Miro Board to Create Illustrations</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						   We provide a Miro board that contains all the basic elements that were used to create the explanatory illustrations on the Patterns. 
						   The Miro board provides a powerful way to visualize AR patterns by offering various pre-designed elements. 
						   These elements can be combined to create new and innovative AR examples and to collaborate on the requirements and implementation of the patterns into new applications and use-cases. 
						   This guide will walk you through how to use these elements to bring your AR concepts to life.
