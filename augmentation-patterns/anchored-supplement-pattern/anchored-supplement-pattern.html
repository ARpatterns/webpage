					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The Anchored Supplement pattern shows an augmentation that adds context to something that was
						detected. For example, after detecting a famous painting, a description of this painting could
						be shown next to the painting. This pattern is applied whenever an augmentation is shown in a
						fixed spacial relationship to a detected entity. In the example above, the description—i.e. the
						supplement—would be shown next to the detected painting—i.e. the anchor. The anchored supplement
						pattern has the intention of adding context to real-world entities in order to describe them or
						otherwise augment them. This pattern is especially well suited to training and educational
						applications or may also have its uses in any case where the real world can benefit from
						contextual augmentations.</p>



					<h2>Augmentation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>placed: relative to detected object</li>
						<li>aligned: with detected object or towards user</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<p>The anchored supplement can be applied if a specific entity is detected and has a point of origin
						which can be designated as anchor. This allows the relative positioning of the supplement. For
						example, showing a 3D Object anchored in a detected tag constitutes a use of this pattern. The
						anchored supplement pattern requires that the detected entity remain visible and that the
						supplement be placed at a fixed spatial relationship to it.

					</p>

					<h2>Use Cases</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Shopping: Show price tag and product information</li>
						<li>Museums: Provide contextual information about exhibit or artist</li>
						<li>Manufacturing: Guide product assembly with augmented support information</li>
					</ul>

								href="/webpage/augmentation-patterns/superimposition-pattern/superimposition-pattern.html">Superimposition
								Pattern: </a>In the anchored supplement pattern, the detected object should not be
							covered. If the detected object is to be covered up with a replacement, the superimposition
							applies. For example, if a painting is covered up with another painting.</li>
						<li><a
								href="/webpage/augmentation-patterns/segment-overlay-pattern/segment-overlay-pattern.html">Segment
								Overlay Pattern: </a>When the entity originates from camera image segmentation rather
							than the detection of an entity in 3D, the segment overlay pattern applies. For example,
							detecting an image segment as the sky, and then recoloring this area.</li>
						<li><a
								href="/webpage/augmentation-patterns/hand-palm-pop-up-pattern/hand-palm-pop-up-pattern.html">Hand/Palm
								Pup-Up Pattern: </a>When the detected entity is a hand or other body part in a
							mixed-reality context and the goal of the augmentation is to add specific functionality with
							UX elements, the Hand/Palm Pop-Up Pattern applies.
