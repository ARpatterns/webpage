							<h2>Using the Miro Board to Create Illustrations</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							As you familiarise yourself with the descriptions, examples and ECA diagrams of AR Patterns,
							you may have noticed that we have consistently used stylized line drawings to illustrate the
							essence of an AR situation. In the spirit of open source, these artworks are based on an
							open design system where you can use backgrounds and cut-out objects (just like stickers!)
							to create your own illustration explaining your AR Pattern. Combine the pre-designed
							elements to describe new and innovative AR examples and collaborate on the requirements and
							implementation of the patterns in new applications and use cases. This guide will walk you
							through how to use these elements to bring your AR concepts to life.

							<h3>Choose your Method</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The easiest way to create an AR illustration is to access our <a
								href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLV7ti88=/?share_link_id=177097345742">Miro board
							</a>. Alongside the set
							of existing examples, you'll find all the necessary backgrounds (a room, a street, or the
							outdoors) and objects (such as furniture, plants, or abstract shapes) available as real,
							detected, and augmented instances. Next, and most importantly, there's the user, represented
							as a simple pair of footsteps. This design choice enables the creation of illustrations that
							are independent of the hardware implementation (e.g. headset or handheld device) and allows
							us to focus on the core idea of the AR pattern. Of course, there are exceptions, such as
							hand pop-up menus or face filters, for which you'll find the appropriate assets. The final
							category is more technical in nature: he orange AR anchors provide a straightforward
							explanation of the augmentation's origin, positioning and orientation in space.

						</span>
						<p>
							If you prefer to work in a vector drawing program (such as Sketch or Adobe Illustrator)
							rather than on the Miro board, you'll find the same assets as SVG files in the download link
							below. This gives you more options as you can modify the existing drawings or create new
							components following the style guide.

						<h3>Scenario Elements</h3>
						<p>
							The Miro board contains a variety of elements that can be used to create AR scenarios.
							These elements include some Environments (indoor / outdoor), objects such as plants and
							tables, and perspectively correct anchors.
							Depending on the application, you may want to choose from different different
							representations of the same objects that fit the overall design. and interactive controls.

						<h2>Steps to Build Your Scenario</h2>
					</header>

					<div class="step">
						<h2>1. Access the Miro Board or Download the Assets</h2>
						<p>To start building your own scenarios, access the Miro Board. Start with a blank 16:9 canvas, marked with the orange 'Start here' sticker.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>2. Choose a Backdrop</h2>
						<p>Depending on your AR scenario, you will need a backdrop. Here are the options available:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>The room (indoors):</strong> Ideal for positioning objects on the floor, in the air, or on the walls in a medium-small scale (0.5 to 2m). For a smaller scale, use the table asset and enlarge the elements.</li>
							<li><strong>The park (outdoor):</strong> Suitable for larger AR objects (2 to 10m) and more pronounced depth scale. The park path can be used for waypoints.</li>
							<li><strong>The street corner:</strong> Similar to the room but suited for geolocation. You can hide elements behind corners.</li>
							<li><strong>A blank canvas:</strong> Use this for scenarios without spatial orientation, such as face masks or POV AR objects.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>3. Select Your Props</h2>
						<p>Props like chairs, tables, and plants are essential semantic cues in AR experiences. Play around with them to describe space, depth, and orientation. Use parallel projection for positioning objects.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>4. Describe the Detected Instance</h2>
						<p>Every AR implementation needs a detection. Here’s how to describe it:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>2D Hatch:</strong> Segmented from the AR hardware’s video stream.</li>
							<li><strong>2D Edge:</strong> Detected objects like chairs.</li>
							<li><strong>3D Corners:</strong> Detected triggers like QR codes.</li>
							<li><strong>3D Point Cloud:</strong> Scanned and detected volumes.</li>
							<li><strong>Combine with Border:</strong> Indicate detected and recognized objects using borders.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><span class="color-box green"></span> Detected instances are represented with bright green lines.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>5. Design Your Augmentation</h2>
						<p>The blue layer represents the augmented instance. The most basic instance is a medium-sized cube, but it can also be a 2D popup. Be abstract yet specific to make the example universally applicable.</p>
						<p><span class="color-box blue"></span> Augmented instances are represented in blue, with shading and some transparency.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>6. Include the User</h2>
						<p>Position the user with purple footsteps to indicate their location and orientation. For augmentations involving the user's body, use POV hands and faces.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>7. Specify the Marker</h2>
						<p>Markers help describe where the augmentation is anchored and oriented:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Origin (circle):</strong> Describes where the augmentation appears.</li>
							<li><strong>Anchor (diamond):</strong> Usually positioned inside the origin, but can be separated.</li>
							<li><strong>Orientation (arrow):</strong> Indicates the direction the object is facing.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><span class="color-box orange"></span> Markers are represented in orange.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div class="step">
						<h2>8. Enhance and Export</h2>
						<p>Enhance your illustration without adding clutter. Keep the style consistent:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Real-world objects are <span class="color-box white"></span> white with <span class="color-box gray"></span> dark gray lines.</li>
							<li>Detected instances are bright green lines.</li>
							<li>Augmented instances are blue with shading and transparency.</li>
							<li>Markers are orange and should not be altered.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Export your 16:9 canvas as a PNG image (1920×1080 pixels) from Miro or your vector software.</p>
